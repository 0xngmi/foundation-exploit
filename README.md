## Exploit
Foundation's NFTCollection contract allows foundation to destroy almost all NFTs minted on their site.

The issue comes from the _selfDestruct() function that NFTCollection contracts have (https://github.com/f8n/fnd-protocol/blob/main/contracts/mixins/collections/SequentialMintCollection.sol#L72), which is callable by owner when totalSupply() is 0.

The problem is that the implementation contract has that function and it's callable by their multisig, which would result in implementation contract self-destroying and all proxies getting bricked, this would lead to all NFTs minted on proxy contracts to be essentially destroyed, since the contracts wouldnt work anymore.

Result: currently theres a 2/6 multisig that can destroy almost all NFTs minted in foundation.

How this would happen:
1. Multisig https://etherscan.io/address/0x9d9C46aCa6a2c5FF6824A92d521b6381f9f8F1a9 issues a tx upgrading https://etherscan.io/address/0x67Df244584b67E8C51B10aD610aAfFa9a402FdB6#code
2. Upgraded version of 0x67Df244584b67E8C51B10aD610aAfFa9a402FdB6 then calls selfDestruct() on https://etherscan.io/address/0xf61f4f2c896219a90670e19e188ebb93fcc002e8 or 0xe38f942Db7a1B4213d6213F70c499B59287b01F1
3. After this, anyone calling any function on NFTContracts, such as transfer(), ownerOf() or tokenUri() will have those functions fail (because the proxy calls implementation contract and that contract has ceased existing), which means that all NFTs disappear

How to fix:
1. Just issue an NFT on https://etherscan.io/address/0xf61f4f2c896219a90670e19e188ebb93fcc002e8 (and other implementation contracts like 0xe38f942Db7a1B4213d6213F70c499B59287b01F1) and send that NFT to a burn address
2. Doing this will make totalSupply > 0 permanently, which will make any future calls to selfDestruct() revert
